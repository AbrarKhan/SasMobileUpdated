<p>If your website or mobile app allows users to create content and make that
    content public to other users, a Content section will inform users that they
    own the rights to the content they have created.</p>
<p>The “Content” clause usually mentions that users must give you
    (the website or mobile app developer) a license so that you can
    share this content on your website/mobile app and to make it available to other users.</p>

<p>Because the content created by users is public to other users,
    a DMCA notice clause (or Copyright Infringement )
    section is helpful to inform users and copyright authors that,</p>
<p>if any content is found to be a copyright infringement,
    you will respond to any DMCA takedown notices received
    and you will take down the content.</p>
